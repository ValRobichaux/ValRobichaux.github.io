      "Unity is something that excited me for a very long time, I really like the approach that the developers have used to create an extremely versatile engine that can support 2D,3D, VR and AR games.  Unity also comes along with absolutely buttery graphics and an extremely great community.  I definitely would like looking into 3D model rendering and help on some indie game projects ",

      "I personally think that Machine learning is going to change the world some day.  Machine learning combines statistics, data mining, and computer learning and meshes them into a unique way to observe and manipulate data.  Data is only getting bigger as the world grows and being able to come up with intelligent decisions based on data will help improve quality of life for everyone. ",

It's something that has really helped me embrace the reality of being a programmer and something that I love doing.  I was always so interested in reading updates and patch notes for my favorite games, so this was something that I really wanted to start in my off time.",
